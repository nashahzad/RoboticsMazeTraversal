# Getting Repository
Install Git or GitBash onto your local machine so as to be able to use git commands to pull, commit and push changes to files to and from your computer.

Windows open up Git Bash terminal, Mac OS open up terminal. Make sure to be familiar with following commands to change to directory that you want to have files in.

- **ls** (Show a full list of all files and folders in your current working directory)
- **cd ..** (Will move you back up one directory)
- **cd DIRECTORY_NAME** (change current working directory to DIRECTORY_NAME)
- **mkdir DIRECTORY_NAME** (Will create a folder with name DIRECTORY_NAME)


If you have SSH keys set up already then just use SSH URL and clone repository into directory you want it to be in on your local machine.

- **git clone git@github.com:nashahzad/RoboticsMazeTraversal.git** (This will clone entire repository into your current working directory)

Otherwise if you do not have SSH keys set up or have no idea what that is that is fine. Just make sure to use HTTPS URL for repository to clone it.

- **git clone https://github.com/nashahzad/RoboticsMazeTraversal.git**

Once you clone repository and are part of group add your name to list of group members by opening up this README.md in a text editor.

Just use git pull to pull down updates to files onto your local machine. If you make any changes make sure to do git add, git commit and git push, so that everyone else can pull and see changes made. Make sure to communicate in group chat on changes pushed onto repository so that everyone can make sure to pull and is looking at latest changes/edits to files. Be at least familiar with following git commands.

- **git status** (Show files that you have recently made changes to on your local machine)
- **git add** FILE_NAME (Use this to add files you have made changes to)
- **git commit** -m "COMMIT MESSAGE" (Then use this command to add commit message about changes you made)
- **git push** (After committing, use this command to push your changes and commits to online repository)
- **git pull** (Use this to pull any changes made by group members to files in repository)
